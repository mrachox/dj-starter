Drawing on case studies from Australia and the Pacific, this book considers what it means to participate in Community-Led Research, for both communities and researchers. How can researchers and communities work together well, and how can research be reimagined using the knowledge of First Nations peoples and other communities to ensure it remains relevant, sustainable, socially just and inclusive?",

   "Abstract": "Canada has a strong track record of community-based research. The Social Sciences and Humanities Council of Canada (SSHRCC) has made partnership research one of the three main components of its funding architecture. Community Based Research Canada (CBRC) supports a national network of university and community researchers working on a broad range of projects addressing issues of high priority on the research and societal agendas. In November 2014, CBRC partnered with the Centre for Community Based Research in Waterloo, Ontario to host a national summit focused on developing standards of excellence for community-based research based on previous work and exemplified by seminal regional case studies. The follow-up is to establish a network of regional hubs of excellence to advance research and its applications to public policy at regional and national levels with standards of excellence derived from the summit serving as guiding principles for best practice.",

   "Abstract": "Community-Based Research (CBR) is rapidly gaining recognitions as an important tool in addressing complex environmental, health and social problems. However, little is known about the Canadian CBR context. A web-based survey including 25 questions was circulated on listservs and via targeted e-mails to investigate the status of CBR in Canada. Univariate and bivariate statistical analyses were performed to examine variables and relationships of interest. Our sample included a cross-section of CBR community and academic practitioners (n = 308). Respondents reported a wide range of project foci, experience, operating budgets and reasons for engaging in their last CBR endeavor. Academic partners were perceived to be most involved at all stages of the research process except dissemination. Service providers were also perceived as being very involved in most stages of research. Community members were substantially less engaged. High levels of satisfaction were reported for both CBR processes and outcomes. Respondents reported a number of positive outcomes as a result of their research endeavors, including changes in both agency and government policies and programs. Our study shows that CBR practitioners are engaged in research on a wide array of Canadian health and social issues that is making a difference. Finding appropriate levels of participation for community members in CBR remains an ongoing challenge.",

They also found that academic researchers (most of the survey respondents) were the most involved throughout the CBR projects while community members were involved in defining research questions, dissemination, and advocacy (p. 109). The authors also found that most respondents were satisfied with both the process and the results emerging from their CBR work. Principal investigators reported the highest satisfaction levels while dissatisfaction was present accross all the actors involved in CBR (p. 110). The most common outputs from these CBR projects included presentations, published papers, and policy documents (p. 110).",
   "Notes": "The authors note that their sample was self-selected and therefore mimght not accurately represent CBR practioners or those invovled in the process. This, in turn, might skew their results regarding satisfaction with CBR projects. They also not that Ontario was overrepresented in their sample meaning that their results might not reflect how CBR practitioners and partitipants might feel in the rest of Canada."

Increasingly, institutions of higher education are looking to these 17 goals as a way to measure their relevance and impact on society – and some are doing this through community- engaged research and learning. This article shares insights from an institutional impact assessment linked to the UN SDGs from the University of Victoria (UVic), located on Coast Salish and Straits Salish territories of the Lekwungen and W_SÁNEÅ Peoples, on the west coast of Canada. The case study provides an overview of the methodology, highlights some of the various ways impact is being measured and speaks to some of the opportunities both for UVic and other universities wishing to pursue a similar process. The results point to a wide range and diversity of impact to society in almost all the UN goals, also documented at various levels (i.e. individual, community, systems).

Community-led learning also had a hight impact on student outcomes (i.e.: development of skills, employement, and profesionall development) although they note that this success might not be reproducible in other contexts (p. 83).

   "Abstract": "The complexity of many urban health problems often makes them ill suited to traditional research approaches and interventions. The resultant frustration, together with community calls for genuine partnership in the research process, has highlighted the importance of an alternative paradigm. Community-based participatory research (CBPR) is presented as a promising collaborative approach that combines systematic inquiry, participation, and action to address urban health problems. Following a brief review of its basic tenets and historical roots, key ways in which CBPR adds value to urban health research are introduced and illustrated. Case study examples from diverse international settings are used to illustrate some of the difficult ethical challenges that may arise in the course of CBPR partnership approaches. The concepts of partnership synergy and cultural humility, together with protocols such as Green et al.’s guidelines for appraising CBPR projects, are highlighted as useful tools for urban health researchers seeking to apply this collaborative approach and to deal effectively with the difficult ethical challenges it can present.",
